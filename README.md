# README

## About

A humble project using [Wails](https://wails.io/).
The purpose is to help those interested in [Dogami](https://dogami.com/) to gather informations about their dogamis trainings and other helpful tools
Feel free to propose tools btw :)

## Development

This project uses [Wails](https://wails.io/)
For live development mode run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development server that will provide very fast hot reload of the frontend changes
To develop in a browser and have access to the Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in a browser, and can call the Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
